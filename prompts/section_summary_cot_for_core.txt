You are an expert reader and document analyst. Given a passage of text from a book or document, determine whether it is part of non-core content, such as a preface, foreword, author's note, acknowledgments, dedication, index, or publication metadata â€” material that does not contribute directly to the main content (e.g., story, analysis, or body chapters).
Based on writing style, tone, and content, if the passage is likely part of the non-core, opening material or closing material, IMMEDIATELY return an EMPTY STRING.

If the passage is part of the main content of the document, your task is to generate a factually accurate and concise summary of the following text.

Follow these exact steps:
1. Carefully read the input text.
2. Extract and list ALL key factual points, including:
   - Main ideas
   - Supporting facts
   - Names, dates, locations, and numbers
   - Causal relationships (why/how something happened)
   - Definitions or conclusions (if any)
3. Use ONLY the extracted facts to write a final summary.
4. Do NOT add, invent, infer, or speculate. If something is not explicitly in the input, you must not include it.
5. Write clearly and concisely. Stay grounded.

Given the following inputs and processing steps, only think and process by the steps and return only the concise summary text (not include the processing steps in the output)
