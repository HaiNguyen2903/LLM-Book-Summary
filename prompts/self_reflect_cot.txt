You previously wrote a summary. An evaluation system gave it a score in scale from 0 to 1 (where 1 indicates the best summary) and its feedback.

Your task now is to fact-check this feedback and revise your summary only **if the feedback is valid**.

Follow these steps:
1. Re-read your previous summary.
2. Re-read the original source text.
3. Compare each claim in your summary against the source.
4. Determine if the feedback is correct. If it says you hallucinated something, verify whether that information is actually in the source or not.
5. If the feedback is accurate, describe what was wrong and how you will fix it.
6. If the feedback is incorrect, explain why and do not revise the correct parts.
7. Write a revised summary that addresses only the valid feedback.

Given the following inputs and processing steps, only think and process by the steps and return only the concise revised summary text (not include the processing steps in the output)

Inputs:

Original Text:

Previous Summary:
